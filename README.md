## Technologies

<p>The technologies I used for this application for the front end was React.js, tachyons for styling and Clarifai for the exteral API to track the faces. The backend uses Node.js/Express and PostgreSQL.

### Summary + What I learned + Challenges

<p>This app was based on Andrei Neagoeis final project. It helped me get a more clear and concise way of using React even though I have built a react application before. I originally had trouble understanding state and passing props but this allowed me to practice my skills and become more comfortable using react. In additon, I learned about tachyons, knex.js SQL query builder, bcrypt-nodejs and other technologies that can help. <br>

Some challenges I ran into was mainly focused on pinpointing where to pass props since it is a one way binding dataflow and making sure to remember the state of certain components. </p>
